# Facebook Messenger for Gnome

This project aims to provide a more native-looking experience of using Facebook Messenger on Gnome through Electron. The project mainly supports Wayland.

## Test the app
> ðŸ’¡ Currently, the app doesn't support rounded corners. A workaround is to use this extension: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1514/rounded-corners/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1514/rounded-corners/)
 1. Clone the project
 2. Run `npm install`
 3. Run `npm --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland`
