# Facebook Messenger for Gnome


This project aims to provide a more native-looking experience of using Facebook Messenger on Gnome through Electron. The project mainly supports Wayland.

## Design

> ðŸ’¡ Currently, the app doesn't support rounded corners (see https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/33036). A workaround is to use this extension: [https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1514/rounded-corners/](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1514/rounded-corners/)
